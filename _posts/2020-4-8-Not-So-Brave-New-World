As this is being written, millions of people are staying home and distancing themselves from others. 
There are likely differences in detail between the societal effects on different countries, but Canada
is probably -- as it so often is -- somewhere in the middle of the array of statistics about economic,
social and medical statistics. 

While it is tempting to agonize about the present, this posting is about the society that will emerge 
in Canada as the pandemic wanes. And wane it will, preferably by dint of collective discipline rather
than survival of the luckiest. 

Some of the lessons of the pandemic appear to be

- that globalization makes us very vulnerable to non-local sources of strategic goods
- that personal services -- recently a rapidly growing economic sector -- can be 
wiped out by a few molecules of protein and nucleic acid
- that we need to pay attention to ensuring our supply chains for food, medicines and equipment,
and other products without which our lives and well-being are at risk
