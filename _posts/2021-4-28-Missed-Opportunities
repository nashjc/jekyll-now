# Missed opportunities for beating Covid

We're into the third Covid wave here in Ontario. 

Unfortunately, political dogma is getting in the way of practicalities.
Public health workers have been telling governments that we need ways
for people to stay at home when they are or might be sick. Even some
enlightened employers are saying they are doing better by paying sick
leave and keeping their workforce functioning. But so-called "common
sense" doctrines are such that our governing group is deaf and blind
to opportunities that are win-win-win.

What do I mean?

Paid sick leave DOES cost money. Not paying it costs our whole society
a lot more. And every scheme that pays money will have cheats and frauds.
So how can we get the benefits and keep the costs tolerable? What follows
is an outline of one possible scenario. 

Before I begin, I will, however, point out that I taught the management
of technological risk in the Telfer School of Management of the University
of Ottawa for some years. And (with Tim Ramsay) I've published ideas about
the first SARS epidemic in 2006. These ideas are mostly notable in how
diligently they've been ignored, but we are not alone -- most recommendations
and plans in Canada to prepare for another epidemic were blithely 
consigned to the trash.

The main goal of paid sick leave is to remove the necessity for people to
go to work so their income is maintained. Reimbursement later probably means
inability to pay for food, shelter and other necessities. If the employer 
pays regular wages, we overcome this immediate obstacle. 

The employer may, of course, find this a burden. And an employee who is
absent may be malingering or working elsewhere to try to get double pay.
That was why we used to have to get doctor's notes. They now cost fairly
serious money and are a nuisance to both the patient / worker as well as
the medical system.

We do, however, have telehealth systems. Could we use telephone or
internet chat methods to report and provide a primary validation that
a worker is sick? With growing availability of tools centered on smart
phones and similar devices, we might even be able to capture data that
confirms at least some symptoms of disease. 

Assuming a telehealth system could provide timely reporting of sickness,
it could also generate a message with a confirmation number to the 
employer. If governments are willing to commit the resources, these
tickets could be submitted by the employer for compensation for paying
sick leave.

At this level, a telehealth reporting system doesn't do a lot more than
the old doctor's note approach. The real gains can come by amplifying the
system in modest but important ways. 

First, we can use statistics from the system to get a much earlier warning
of potential disease outbreaks.

Second, if governments are willing to fund a modest system of health
visitors -- a very old-fashioned idea -- we could acquire much better
information on what is really happening. Though it is almost certain that
health visitors would check only a small sample of all reports, tests
and diagnostic measurements would add a great deal to understanding of
the reasons for reports. For example, in the current pandemic, knowledge 
of variant viruses is becoming increasingly pertinent.

A by-product of visits would be a check, albeit likely a sample only, on
the possibility of invalid claims for sick leave.

This outline system would not solve all the issues related to sick leave.
It does, however, address some of the obstacles that some politicians put in 
the way of doing the right thing. Moreover, if we integrate the economic
and public health tools we could put in place, we will be better able to
beat epidemic disease quickly.
