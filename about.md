### This blog.

In this collection (nashjc.github.io), I include blogs about anything outside of
my computing and statistical work with the **R** project.

My **R** work blogs are fed to [https://www.r-bloggers.com/](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) from [https://nashjc.wordpress.com/](https://nashjc.wordpress.com/).
